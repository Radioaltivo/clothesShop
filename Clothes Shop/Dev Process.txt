This is a simple documentation of the development process of a Small-Scale Clothes Shop Sim

I'm using assets from Kenney https://www.kenney.nl/ which I generally use for prototypes and placeholder

First I built a simple room using the tiled assets. The idea is to spread the clothes around like a department store.
To keep clothing replacement as simple as possible, I just sliced the tilemap keeping each clothing piece with the same size, so I can just switch them up vioa code. Ideally, I'd have a tilesheet for each clothing piece and slice them by fixed amounts, but for a prototype my process will be enough.

The character will have very simple movements using transform, as I only need collision calculation and not much else from the Physics package. I'll also keep the UI to a minimum as I like this kind of aesthetic.


The clothes will be placed on tables and the character can interact with them to put them on. The clothing currently being worn will them be replaced. I will use scriptables to hold clothing data and the player controller will manage what is being worn. This way it would be easy to scale the game, just needed the tilemap changes mentioned above.

Downloaded a free pixel art from https://www.dafont.com/pt/pixeled.font to match my assets, but UI will still be kept to a minimum. As this is a protype I'll not spend a lot of time with anchoring and just fix a 16:10 resolution
